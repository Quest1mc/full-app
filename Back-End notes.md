google login now working  
:smile:

8th April : After over 2 weeks of trying to figure out if facebook login will work with instagram I have finally discovered when they(facebook) removed instagram authentication they did not provide an alternative.
Thus things to note in certain user cases 
user has facebook = :unlock:
user has email = :unlock:
user has only instagram? = create account with either facebook or email and then :unlock:

facebook login now working  
:smile:

instagram token accessed
