        "description": "Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. They don’t want us to eat. We the best. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise.",
