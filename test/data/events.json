The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. They don’t want us to eat. We the best. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise.",
